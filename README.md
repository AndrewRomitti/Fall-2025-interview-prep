# 💻 Interview Prep 2025

I made this repo to journal and keep track of my daily interview grind for the Fall 2025 Internship cycle. It will include LeetCode-style problems, explanations, behavioral interview stuff, and all that is needed for me to hopefully not get cooked.

## Why I made this

I want to:

- Master core DSA
- Practice real patterns (NeetCode 150)
- Build consistency with daily problems solving
- Keep track of what I learn and my growth
- Stay accountable, hopefully commiting to this and getting that green github graph will make me locked in 💚

## Repo Structure 📁

- problems/ -> LeetCode problems categorized by topic from NeetCode 150
- recaps/ -> Weekly recaps I do on my progress
- clown/ -> Explained further down

## Schedule 📆

- ✅ 1-2 LeetCode problems per day (will ramp up when I get back to college, but rn I work full time :/)
- ✅ Fully written explanation for each problem I solve
- ✅ Weekly recap of progress + goals

## Progress Tracker ✅

## Clown-Driven Development (CDD)

If anyone catches me slipping, like I am missing a week, or not pushing anything in this folder then PLEASE open a pull request adding a file in the `/clown/` directory to roast me.

### Rules:

- Clown me only if I am lacking
- Bonus points for memes, markdown roasts, all of that
- If it's valid then I will merge it to keep myself accountable
