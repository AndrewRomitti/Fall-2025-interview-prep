# 💻 Interview Prep 2025

I made this repo to journal and keep track of my daily interview grind for the Fall 2025 Internship cycle. It will include LeetCode-style problems, explanations, behavioral interview stuff, and all that is needed for me to hopefully not get cooked.

## Why I made this

I want to:  
- Master core DSA
- Practice real patterns (NeetCode 150)
- Build consistency with daily problems solving  
- Keep track of what I learn and my growth
- Stay accountable, hopefully commiting to this and getting that green github graph will make me locked in 💚

## Clown-Driven Development (CDD)

If anyone catches me slipping, like I am missing a week, or not pushing anything in this folder then PLEASE open a pull request adding a file in the `/clown/` directory to roast me.

### Rules:
- Clown me only if I am lacking  
- Bonus points for memes, markdown roasts, all of that  
- If it's valid then I will merge it to keep myself accountable
